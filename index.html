Invitation only - if you'd like to come, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WpPuXp_BuWr5vDlfVO7JAJIPlKVDvwEY3QvuNoj_htk/viewform">tell us about yourself</a>.

<li>Finish game by 11pm sharp. </li>
<li>Games are played at Kongregate HQ in downtown San Francisco.</li>
<li>$60 buy-in plus 2 rebuys in the first hour.</li>
<li>$60 = starting stack of chips worth $1000.</li>
<li>Blinds start at $5 and $10, going up every 15 minutes.</li>
<li>The number of cashes and amount depends on number of players and rebuys.</li>
<li>Each player agrees in advance to donate 33% of their winnings to the prize pool (rounded to the nearest $20) and they get 1 point per $1 contributed.</li>
</ul><hr><ul>
<li>Grand prize: Entry to a WSOP side event (we'll go for the main event next year).</li>
<li>If our champion cashes, he/she keeps 20% off the top and the other 80% is paid out accordingly to the points earned during the regular season.</li>
<li>Top 10 players in the regular season will play in a playoff tournament to determine the grand prize winner. The starting chips for each of the players will be their season points times 10.</li>
