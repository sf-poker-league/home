            <li>$60 buy-in plus 1 re-buy or add-on in the first hour</li>
            <li>$60 = starting stack of chips worth $1000</li>

            <li>The number of cashes and amount depends on number of players and rebuys.</li>

            <h4>Prizes</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Entries to a WSOP $1,500 event, plus travel subsidy.</strong></li>
              <li>Top 10 players in the regular season will play in a playoff tournament to determine who will go the WSOP. We should have enough in our prize pool to send several players.</li>
              <li>The starting chips for each of the players will be their season points times 10. In the case of a tie for 10th, we will choose one of the tied players randomly.</li>
              <li>If one of our champions cashes, they keep 20% off the top and the other 80% is paid out accordingly to the points earned during the regular season (including their points). E.g. if the champ had 50% of the season points, they would keep 20% + (50% * 80%) = 60%</li>
              <li>Mid-season points leader gets entry into a $225 Lucky Chances Sunday tournament ($10K guarantee)</li>
