          <p>A poker league for game developers and techies in San Francisco (inspired by the Silicon Valley Poker League). Members only - if you'd like to come, <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sf-poker-league">request to join our Google group</a> and tell us about yourself. Each member is allowed to bring one guest, if the member is present.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Weekly tournaments on Mondays</li>
            <li>Food and drinks at 6:30pm </li>
            <li>Cards in the air at 7pm</li>
            <li>Finish game by 11pm sharp</li>
            <li>Games are played at <a href="http://www.kongregate.com">Kongregate</a> HQ, at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=2+Shaw+Alley,+San+Francisco,+CA">2 Shaw Alley</a> in downtown San Francisco.</li>
            <li>$60 buy-in plus 1 re-buy or add-on in the first hour</li>
            <li>$60 = starting stack of chips worth $1000</li>
            <li>Blinds start at $5 and $10, going up every 15 minutes</li>
            <li>The number of cashes and amount depends on number of players and rebuys.</li>
            <li>Each player agrees in advance to donate 33% of their winnings to the prize pool (rounded to the nearest $20) and they get 1 point per $1 contributed.</li>
          </ul>

            <ul>
            <li><strong>Entry to a $1,500 WSOP side event + $400 travel subsidy</strong></li>
            <li>Top 10 players in the regular season will play in a playoff tournament on May 27th to determine who will go the WSOP - we're currently on pace to send 3. The starting chips for each of the players will be their season points times 10. In the case of a tie for 10th, we will choose one of the tied players randomly.</li>
            <li>If one of our champions cashes, they keep 20% off the top and the other 80% is paid out accordingly to the points earned during the regular season (including their points). E.g. if the champ had 50% of the season points, they would keep 20% + (50% * 80%) = 60%</li>
